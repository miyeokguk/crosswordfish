## About

![Crosswordfish screenshot](https://github.com/peterjunpark/crosswordfish/assets/115042610/39b11d45-e10f-4e50-a782-c83851c40931)

Crosswordfish is a haven for crossword enthusiasts. Here, you can play (ostensibly) random and unique crossword puzzles generated by AI. The puzzles are not stored on any server somewhere, they're made as soon as you hit _Play_.

The app features most of the UX features you'd expect from a digital crossword gameboard. You can reset the grid, reveal errors, and show solutions when you get stuck.
And importantly, you can navigate the grid using your just your keyboard.

However, Crosswordfish is still very much an MVP and has a few limitations. The most obvious limitations are in how it _generates_ crossword puzzles.
Currently, the app is only able to generate _freeform_ grid layouts due to the much greater complexity of generating American-style grid layouts.
And by the same token, the app is only able to generate _straight_ crossword clues, due to the creative complexity of generating cryptic (UK-style) clues.

If you're not sure what I mean by that, [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossword) explains the different styles of crossword grids and clues and why
certain types of grid/clue constraints might be challenging to work with.

### Why?

Where else can you play crossword puzzles online without being bombarded by ads, on a puzzle grid that actually takes up more than a fifth of your viewport, and with new puzzles on-demand?

### Built with

These are the main technologies used to build Crosswordfish. Have a look at the `package.json` file for a full list of dependencies.

* [React](https://react.dev)
* [Next.js 14 (App router)](https://nextjs.org)
* [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction)
* [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)
* [OpenAI](https://openai.com) (GPT-3.5-turbo-1106)

## Installation

First, get the things you'll need:

### Prerequisites

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
  ```sh
  npm i -g pnpm
  ```
* Obtain a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
  > You may need to fund your account if you've run out of API tokens.

### Getting started

Now, complete these steps:

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/peterjunpark/crosswordfish.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies via pnpm
   ```sh
   cd crosswordfish
   pnpm i
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key.
   ```
   OPEN_AI_API_KEY= ...
   ```
4. Start the development server
   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

You should now be able to navigate to `http://localhost:3001` and play some crosswords üòÅ.
